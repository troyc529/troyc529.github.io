# Overview

The initial problem our group identified was the lack of community involvement in taking care of local environment. Our app’s purpose is to allow users easy engagement with taking care of their local environment through public events as well as provide a source to learn more about their local area. The app provides a platform to host events where users can easily sign up and participate, for example a user could host an event for a local park clean up, the app would provide details regarding the event and would allow users to sign up and share the event with friends to promote more engagement. We also hope as a byproduct of the app is that it creates more communities so people can develop of a sense of belonging to something positive. The app also provides education through articles and videos that are related to the users local area.

# Milestone2 Analysis

## Research

### Methods used: 
5 people participated. Interviews were both conducted in person as well as over the phone. All participants are 18-24 years old and 4 are college students, 1 is a business owner. We believed questionnaire guided interviews would be best to create a conversation about environmental care with our interviewee and gather a broad amount of information regarding the subject. 
We analyzed the data using the Miro board, where we used thematic analysis. Since most of our data was qualitative, we were able to pose our questions which extracted key information about the participant. We were able to find out what kind of place they live in (house, apartment, condo, car, etc.) We also asked the participant to define community, and a series of questions to gauge their involvement (and tendencies to help) in their community. We also let each interviewer let the conversation flow and pose their own questions as needed, rather than stick to a script. 
We broke into the data into subheadings, where each subheading was something familiar between all the interviews. Five people were involved in the analysis process. The interviews were mostly conducted over the phone, except for one face-to-face interview. 


## Findings

### Direct Impact

When discussing with the interviewees about how aware they were about their local environment and community, the common response is that while they were aware of environmental issues in general, they felt that it did not directly impact them. If they were directly impacted by environmental issues, then they would be more inclined to take action. For example, one interviewee mentioned that they felt an obligation to maintain the cleanliness of their immediate area since it is where they reside and is affected by it. One interviewer posed a scenario to their interviewee: “If there was a community park across the street and it needed to be cleaned up, what would motivate the interviewee to help in that process?” The interviewee’s response was that he would have to smell the garbage from his home, adding to the idea that one would only start to act once the impact became perceivably direct.
Another finding relating to the idea of how directly impacted the interviewees were by environmental issues within their community is how invested/ connected they were to their surroundings. One interviewee stated that since they lived in an apartment, they felt somewhat detached to their environment, while another mentioned that due to the pandemic, they don’t leave their home as much, causing them to not feel directly impacted by these issues in the present. The lack of connection towards their surroundings meant that participating in any kind of community or environmental related events isn’t a priority for them. 

### Incentives

Having some kind of incentive to participate in environmental cleanups or any community involved event is a reoccurring theme throughout the interviews we conducted. Through our analysis, we found that there are two types of incentives that influence participation: tangible incentives and social incentives. 

Tangible Incentive

These incentives are something that the participant can gain tangible benefits from, such as having a clean space for concerts, events, food trucks, and free admissions or food during the cleanups. One interviewee mentioned that if they had a direct stake in the area, for example if he had built a home there or had some other type of large investment, financial or otherwise, he would be more opted to help.   

Social Incentive

Social incentives include having something or someone motivate the interviewee to participate. One example brought up in an interview was having a close friend invite them to a cleanup to make them feel less awkward when going alone. There is also the aspect where if the cleanups can somehow be organized as events where people gather up, eat snacks, and play games while cleaning the place where they have gathered, it would be more enjoyable to those involved and might motivate them to participate in similar events more.   

### Education/Awareness

All the interviewees agreed that education plays a huge role in creating awareness about environmental issues. When asked about why there is a lack of motivation for bringing a change into their local environment even though the curriculum in most schools involves subjects on awareness, two of my interviewees gave an interesting response. The gist of their answer was that while schools today teach the students what problems exist, why they need to be solved, and how they can be solved, the problem is that it’s all theoretical. One of them said that the schools are successfully creating awareness in the students, but not the motivation to solve these problems. The students, in turn, develop sympathy for these issues but not empathy. The schools should focus more on organizing cleanups, that is focus should be placed more on the solution rather than the problem.

### Importance of Community

All of the interviewee’s agreed that being a part of a community is important. When asked about the definition and importance of community, one interviewee responded with 1. A group of people that live in the same area and share resources. 2. Community is important to be a part of something because it brings people together. To the interviewees, being a part of a community directly adds to their happiness in life and lets them be a part of something.

## Implications for Design:
Through our findings, we found that incentives are an important aspect when trying to get participation. On each post incentives will be displayed so that a user can click on it and see what potential incentives there are to participating. The base incentive will be points towards the users overall score which is displayed in the top right corner. These points can be earned by signing up to volunteering events, or by watching/ reading articles in the environmental awareness page. Since education was also a factor in our findings, where the interviewee knew very little to none about their local environment, we decided to design an environmental awareness page. This page will have information about the user’s local environment and actions they can take to aid with any environmental issues within their community.
   


From our data, having a way to go with friends or people the user met from a volunteering event through our app is one key idea from our findings. This would allow the user to create and maintain connections with others within their community. Having a share button would also allow users to share and invite others to volunteering events, creating an opportunity to interact with other people and act as a motivator to participating in these kinds of events by going with another person and feeling less awkward if they were to go alone.

## Design Iterations
![:)]({{site.url}}/assets/img/educationb4after.jpg)
After reviewing our design we found the first iteration did not maximize the space so we developed a design to incorporate more videos into the page

![:)]({{site.url}}/assets/img/volb4after.jpg)
Initially the volunteering page lacked a feature to share with friends so we added that in the final design

![:)]({{site.url}}/assets/img/getintouchB4After.JPG)
In our first iteration our Navbar was cropped by the curvature of the phone so we updated that in for the final design

![:)]({{site.url}}/assets/img/friendlistB4After.JPG)
Initially we lacked a feature to add friends to friends list we incorporated this in the final design

![:)]({{site.url}}/assets/img/backbuttonB4After.JPG)
At first the only way to navigate the App was the navbar, to increase ease of use for user we incorporated a back button


# Usability Test
We iterated many times on our initial design. Through a usability test, we were able to get real insight into our app's inefficencies/problems. Our users found that our application was difficult to navigate, mainly about our awareness page once the user was logged in. The main issue was that our awareness page was not organized. We iterated on this advice and formatted the environmental articles and videos in a grid, so the user can navigate them more freely. Another big issue throughout our application was that we did not have a mechanism to go back to previous pages/views. We added back arrows on all of the pages per the advice of our users. We also had a few components that needed to be positioned better. Namely, the navbar was too high, so we moved it down and added functional icons. We also made it easier to share posts with friends by placing a distinct share button aside each post. In addition, we added popups for adding friends and sharing posts with friends that prompts the user to input the recipient's email address. 




# Future Design

Currently the app is broken down into two portions, one being the social side which consists of hosting and signing up for events and the other is the educational side where users can go and learn about their local environment. Moving forward the app could provide more for the user similarly how facebook started as a site where users can have their own personal page to where now it has a marketplace, dating service, and a tv service. While considering the main objectives of an app is important one thing we learned is to not forgot about the functionalities that most users take for granted. For example, in our initial iteration we did not have an option for the user to go back to the previous page they had to use the navbar and select that specific page to go back. To promote use of the app navigation through its content should be as effortless as possible.
