<!-- # Leaf, Your Environmental Community Starts Here -->

# Overview

The initial problem our group identified was the lack of community involvement in taking care of local environment. Our app’s purpose is to allow users easy engagement with taking care of their local environment through public events as well as provide a source to learn more about their local area. The app provides a platform to host events where users can easily sign up and participate, for example a user could host an event for a local park clean up, the app would provide details regarding the event and would allow users to sign up and share the event with friends to promote more engagement. We also hope as a byproduct of the app is that it creates more communities so people can develop of a sense of belonging to something positive. The app also provides education through articles and videos that are related to the users local area.

# Milestone2 Analysis
## Direct Impact
	When discussing with the interviewees about how aware they were about their local environment and community, the common response is that while they were aware of environmental issues in general, they felt that it did not directly impact them. If they were directly impacted by environmental issues, then they would be more inclined to take action. For example, one interviewee mentioned that they felt an obligation to maintain the cleanliness of their immediate area since it is where they reside and is affected by it. One interviewer posed a scenario to their interviewee: “If there was a community park across the street and it needed to be cleaned up, what would motivate the interviewee to help in that process?” The interviewee’s response was that he would have to smell the garbage from his home, adding to the idea that one would only start to act once the impact became perceivably direct.
	Another finding relating to the idea of how directly impacted the interviewees were by environmental issues within their community is how invested/ connected they were to their surroundings. One interviewee stated that since they lived in an apartment, they felt somewhat detached to their environment, while another mentioned that due to the pandemic, they don’t leave their home as much, causing them to not feel directly impacted by these issues in the present. The lack of connection towards their surroundings meant that participating in any kind of community or environmental related events isn’t a priority for them.    
## Incentives
	Having some kind of incentive to participate in environmental cleanups or any community involved event is a reoccurring theme throughout the interviews we conducted. Through our analysis, we found that there are two types of incentives that influence participation: tangible incentives and social incentives.     
### Tangible Incentive
		These incentives are something that the participant can gain tangible benefits from, such as having a clean space for concerts, events, food trucks, and free admissions or food during the cleanups. One interviewee mentioned that if they had a direct stake in the area, for example if he had built a home there or had some other type of large investment, financial or otherwise, he would be more opted to help.   
### Social Incentive
		Social incentives include having something or someone motivate the interviewee to participate. One example brought up in an interview was having a close friend invite them to a cleanup to make them feel less awkward when going alone. There is also the aspect where if the cleanups can somehow be organized as events where people gather up, eat snacks, and play games while cleaning the place where they have gathered, it would be more enjoyable to those involved and might motivate them to participate in similar events more.    
## Education/Awareness
    All the interviewees agreed that education plays a huge role in creating awareness about environmental issues. When asked about why there is a lack of motivation for bringing a change into their local environment even though the curriculum in most schools involves subjects on awareness, two of my interviewees gave an interesting response. The gist of their answer was that while schools today teach the students what problems exist, why they need to be solved, and how they can be solved, the problem is that it’s all theoretical. One of them said that the schools are successfully creating awareness in the students, but not the motivation to solve these problems. The students, in turn, develop sympathy for these issues but not empathy. The schools should focus more on organizing cleanups, that is focus should be placed more on the solution rather than the problem.
## Importance of Community
	All of the interviewee’s agreed that being a part of a community is important. When asked about the definition and importance of community, one interviewee responded with 1. A group of people that live in the same area and share resources. 2. Community is important to be a part of something because it brings people together. To the interviewees, being a part of a community directly adds to their happiness in life and lets them be a part of something.
